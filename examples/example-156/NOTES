1) My assumption that that "ansible_python_interpreter" would affect the
   version of the modul setup.py was wrong.

      module file /usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/ansible/modules/

   This is the version of Python at master Ansible is running with

      ansible-playbook -vvv -i inventory --limit=dev_FE  main.yml
      ansible-playbook 2.8.3
      config file = /WALLETHUB/ansible/patch_server/ansible.cfg
      configured module search path = ['/var/root/.ansible/plugins/modules',
      '/usr/share/ansible/plugins/modules']
      ansible python module location = 
      /usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/ansible
      executable location = /usr/local/bin/ansible-playbook
      python version = 3.7.4 (default, Jul  9 2019, 18:13:23) [Clang 10.0.1 
      (clang-1001.0.46.4)]

   As a result, this Python version is not an indicator of what is going on at
   remote host.

2) I've tested remote host FreeBSD 12.0 from the master Ubuntu 18.04. All is
   working well with Ansible 2.8.3 and Python 2.7 at master 

      ansible 2.8.3
      config
   file= /export/home/vlado.config/.ansible/ansible-examples/examples/example-155/ansible.cfg
      configured module search path =
      [u'/home/vlado/.ansible/plugins/modules',
      u'/usr/share/ansible/plugins/modules'] ansible python module location
      = /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible executable location
      = /usr/bin/ansible python version = 2.7.15+ (default, Nov 27 2018,
      23:36:35) [GCC 7.3.0]

   both with Python 2.7

      test_01 | SUCCESS => {
             "ansible_facts": {
                 [...]
                 "ansible_python_version": "2.7.16",

   and Python 3.6 at the remote host.

      test_01 | SUCCESS => {
             "ansible_facts": {
                 [...]
                 "ansible_python_version": "3.6.7",

3) It's left to find out if the problem is Ansible 2.8 with Python3 in
   general, or if this is a distro problem.
