* Feature request: make synchronize module idempotent by using the rsync "--dry-run" flag #37501
  https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/37501

  rsync changes owner,group and permissions of the destination
  directory. If the destination directory is created in the play
  before the synchronize task and owner,group and/or permissions are
  set it may potentially make following synchronize task to change
  it. This might seem like synchronize module is not idempotent.
